# COMP30013 - Research Project on Voice Assistant

## Introduction

Spenser is a personalised companion Voice Assistant (VA) that is built specifically for expense tracking by chatting with the user. They will be asked to select human-like traits setting for the VA and different dialogue responses are triggered according to role settings and expense scenarios. Human-like trait means VA acts like a real person during its interactions with users based on the characteristics of its voice (e.g. gender, pitch, softness, wording, and tone). This inter-personal level of communication feature will make the user feel more emotionally attached to Spenser because it will respond with care and provide company and comfort to the users.

NOTE: This is only the first prototype
