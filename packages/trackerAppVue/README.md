# Installation

## Requirements

- NodeJS
- npm or yarn
- Google Account and Dialogflow V2 Agent (if you look for V1, please use my [old repo](https://github.com/mishushakov/dialogflow-web))

## Backend

Dialogflow Gateway enables third-party integrations like this to securely access the Dialogflow V2 API

- [Documentation](https://github.com/mishushakov/dialogflow-gateway-docs)
- [Implementations](https://github.com/mishushakov/dialogflow-gateway-docs#implementations)

`AD` [Dialogflow Gateway by Ushakov (Hosted)](https://dialogflow.cloud.ushakov.co) is the quickest way to get started with Dialogflow for Web v2

## Clone the repository

You can use git or download from GitHub

![Clone Dialogflow for Web v2](https://imgur.com/bpHE9K6.png)

## Install the dependencies

Open the cloned folder. Then, using your package manager install the dependencies

Using npm

`npm i`

Using yarn

`yarn`

## Connect the Agent

Open `src/config/index.js` and change the `endpoint` variable to your Dialogflow Gateway URL

Hint: the URL for [Dialogflow Gateway Hosted by Ushakov](https://dialogflow.cloud.ushakov.co) is always your google cloud project id + `.core.ushaflow.io`. If you have any troubles, make sure you connected your Agent to the Gateway, then visit the [console](https://dialogflow.cloud.ushakov.co/console/), click on "Manage" and copy the Gateway URL

Example

```js
export default {
    endpoint: 'https://dialogflow-web-v2.core.ushaflow.io'
    [...]
}

[...]
```

The logo, agent name, description and available languages are fetched from Dialogflow. Change them in Dialogflow and it will sync to the UI. Please note, when adding new languages, you may have to translate some of the UI as well (`translations.json` in `src/translations`)

## Develop

Open your cloned folder. Then, using your favorite package manager run the `serve` command

Using npm

`npm run serve`

Using yarn

`yarn serve`

Your default browser should open and redirect to `localhost:8080`. If the port 8080 is already in use, you can give a `port` argument to connect at specified port

Using npm

`npm run serve --port 9090`

Using yarn

`yarn serve --port 9090`

**PLEASE DO NOT USE THE DEVELOPMENT SERVER TO SERVE YOUR APP FOR VISITORS, DEVELOPMENT SERVER IS MEANT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT. PLEASE UPLOAD BUILD ARTIFACTS TO A STATIC WEB-SERVER**

## Theme

![Theme Dialogflow for Web v2](https://i.imgur.com/nQ7tK3d.png)

You can also optimize your theme for Dark-mode-enabled clients within the same file and selector under the `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`

## Build

Your app will be bundled to the `dist` directory

To build it you can use npm or yarn

Using npm

`npm run build`

Using yarn

`yarn build`

## Update

Run `git pull origin master` to integrate changes

Additionally, keep vue packages up-to-date

```
vue upgrade
```
