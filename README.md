# Spenser - A Personalised Conversational Expense Tracker

This is Spenser's front-end repository, please check [here](https://github.com/HelenLyuRey/COMP30013-2022-Spenser-Backend) for back-end.

## Introduction

Statistics proves that English voice input can increase productivity by 3 times than typing, it is convenient when the user's hands are occupied as well as benefit the users that has physical disabilities. 

While there are some voice-based expense trackers available on the market, none of them will engage with the user by replying small talks but are only used as an emotionless tool. To solve these challenges, I decided to build an APP, Spenser. 

It is a personalized companion VA that is built specifically for expense tracking by chatting with the user. It allows users to use voice entries to conveniently record money inflow and outflow. It will not only increase user's financial capability, but also improve customer engagement and reduce stress by replying with some cheerful conversations and provide company. The user will be asked to select voice agent and different dialogue responses are triggered according to role settings and expense scenarios. 

(This software is initially made for University of Melbourne COMP30013 Advanced Studies in Computing subject.)
